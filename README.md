# nand2tetris - project solutions.

This reposidoty includes the soultions for the projects in the online course [nand2tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/).

The solutions here are not supposed to incentivise you to cheat your way through the course, but as a last resort if you get stuck. Or if you just need to talk about the projects.

Join me in my journey building the 'hack' computer! :D
